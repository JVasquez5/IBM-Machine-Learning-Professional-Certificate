    "**Context:**\n",
    "   * Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.\n",
    "   * The UN expects that by 2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Parallel to notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which accounts for 295 000 deaths during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017). The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * In light of what was mentioned above, Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:**\n",
    "* This dataset contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetritians into 3 classes:\n",
    "    * 1 = Normal\n",
    "    * 2 = Suspect\n",
    "    * 3 = Pathological\n",

    "   * Main objective of the analysis that specifies whether your model will be focused on prediction or interpretation and the benefits that your analysis provides to the business or stakeholders of this data.\n",
    "   * Brief description of the data set you chose, a summary of its attributes, and an outline of what you are trying to accomplish with this analysis.\n",
    "   * Brief summary of data exploration and actions taken for data cleaning and feature engineering.\n",
    "   * Summary of training at least three different classifier models, preferably of different nature in explainability and predictability. For example, you can start with a simple logistic regression as a baseline, adding other models or ensemble models. Preferably, all your models use the same training and test splits, or the same cross-validation method.\n",
    "   * A paragraph explaining which of your classifier models you recommend as a final model that best fits your needs in terms of accuracy and explainability.\n",
    "   * Summary Key Findings and Insights, which walks your reader through the main drivers of your model and insights from your data derived from your classifier model.\n",
    "   * Suggestions for next steps in analyzing this data, which may include suggesting revisiting this model after adding specific data features that may help you achieve a better explanation or a better prediction."
