## Project 2:  Exploratory Data Analysis Project
* Target Goal
  * Create three linear regression models which should be variations that cover using a simple linear regression as a baseline, adding polynomial effects, and using a regularization regression. Preferably, all use the same training and test splits, or the same cross-validation method.
